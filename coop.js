	"characteristics":
`Designed to be a language with the class structure of Simulcra 67 with no performance drop compared to C, that could be used in all the same applications as C. Includes virtual methods, dynamic binding of method calls and method name and operator overloading, and reference types. It has both functions and methods, meaning it can be both procedural and object oriented. It supports multiple inheritance, and has significantly different exception handling from Ada.`,
	"contributions":
`Was the first object-oriented language that was suitable for large commercial projects.`,
	"comments":
`Early popularity was influenced by the availability of effective compilers and similarity to/backwards compatibility with C.`
