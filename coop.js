	"characteristics":
`Large and complicated; as such, not good for programs where reliability was necessary. This also made it difficult to build a compiler for. Ada is an imperative language.`,
	"contributions":
`Ada packages provided support for the use of data abstraction. It also introduced exception handling and concurrent tasks. Finally, Ada allowed for generic programs, which would handle data without specifying type until instantiation. Ada allows programmers to specify the range for scalar types (int, double, etc.) unlike C based programming languages.`,
	"comments":
`It’s often said that this program was mainly successful due to funding from the Department of Defense. It was required for any military program to be written in Ada from 1991 until 1997. People speculate that ending the “Ada Mandate” led to a drop in popularity of the language.`

	"characteristics":
`Designed to be a language with the class structure of Simulcra 67 with no performance drop compared to C, that could be used in all the same applications as C. Includes virtual methods, dynamic binding of method calls and method name and operator overloading, and reference types. It has both functions and methods, meaning it can be both procedural and object oriented. It supports multiple inheritance, and has significantly different exception handling from Ada.`,
	"contributions":
`Was the first object-oriented language that was suitable for large commercial projects.`,
	"comments":
`Early popularity was influenced by the availability of effective compilers and similarity to/backwards compatibility with C.`
