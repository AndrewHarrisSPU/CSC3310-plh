	"org": "IBM",
	"www": "http://www.snobol4.org",

	"characteristics":
`Designed specifically for string and text manipulation. Based around powerful operations related to string pattern matching. Dynamically typed, which makes it slower than other programming languages.`,
	"contributions":
`One of the first dynamically typed languages.`,
	"comments":
`Because of its high-powered pattern recognition, SNOBOL could be used to implement an interpreter for a language with just a few hundred lines based on the Backus-Naur form.`

	"dev": "Alan Kay",

	"www": "https://www.instantiations.com/products/vasmalltalk/",

	"characteristics":
`Smalltalk is composed entirely of objects. These objects send messages to other objects, triggering a response of some sort. Syntax is unusual, due to the use of messages rather than arithmetic logic expressions and control statements.`,
	"contributions":
`Smalltalk was the first language with full support for object oriented programming. This is a major impact, since most popular languages and design frameworks are based on object oriented principles. It was also the first language designed with the intention of working with graphical user interfaces built for non-programmers. The model-view-controller pattern was made for smalltalk.`,
	"comments":
`Was built with the intention of being used for programming personal computers, which did not exist at the time.`
