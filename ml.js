	"characteristics":
`Characteristics of the language: Impure functional programming language that has some elements of imperative programming. Allows creation of algebraic data types. Modules allow separation of code and creation of abstract data types.`,
	"contributions":
`Isabelle, a major automated theorem prover, is written in SML.`,
	"comments":
`Has a formal specification, unlike most other programming languages.`

	"org": "University of Edinburgh",
	"www": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/ml/",

	"characteristics":
`Functional but not purely functional, due to potential side effects from functions running. Has automatic memory collection. Supports imperative programming and has syntax similar to imperative programming languages.`,
	"contributions":
`One of the most influential functional programming languages. Used frequently for scientific study of programming languages.`,
	"comments":
`Due to its pattern matching and other features, ML is frequently used to process other programming languages, through compiler writing or other methods. It was originally written for this purpose.`

	"contributions":
`Scala demonstrates that more things are possible on the JVM that Java.`,
	"comments":
`Scala brings functional and type-inferential sytles to the JVM.`
