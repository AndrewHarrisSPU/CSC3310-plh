`At a glance, Simula ("SIMUlation LAnguage") is an ALGOL-like structured language. However, while Smalltalk is often cited as the first object-oriented language, many histories suggest that Simula introduces key ideas: classes, subclasses, and virtual methods. Smalltalk merely insisted that everything is an object, and that objects only communicate through message passing. This is not a standard many familiar object-oriented languages meet. (Pop quiz: does C++ meet this standard? does JavaScript?)`
